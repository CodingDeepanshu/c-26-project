Cooking Instructions

Heat 1 tbsp of oil and shallow fry the paneer 
In the same pan add another 1/2 tsp of oil (If you are skipping the above step then add 1 tbsp of oil).
Once it is heated, gently add onion-chili paste and ginger-garlic paste. Cook the mixture on low to medium flame, from time to time add water so that it doesnâ€™t stick to the base.
Once the above mixture browns slightly then add tomato puree, mix it and then add cumin powder, coriander powder, salt, sugar, red chili powder and garam masala powder.
Cook the above masala until it starts releasing oil which you will notice after 15 to 20 minutes
Add spinach puree.

Lastly, check for the seasoning.
